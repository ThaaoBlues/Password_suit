# Password_suit
PWGEN is a simple but good password generator, no options to influence the process like choosing the lenght yet, but maybe in few versions.
The password is automatically sotred in the clipboard after generation, you just need to paste it and here you go.

PWMAN is a extremely simple password manager based on a ugly ui but i'm not a graphist. The key to decrypt the passwords is created on the root of the script files,
so please, use it on an USB key to avoid all risks. to delete a website in the password manager, just go to the data folder, 
then websites and delete the file named by <the name you've choosen>.data*

PWMAN_v2 basically PWMAN but with a new html based UI and with PWGEN directly integrated in.


compiling these scripts is possible, just use the "auto-py-to-exe" tool : https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/
